1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses? 

A client is a browser making request to the server. For example, when the user enter some
search request into the browser, the browser locate the server (which is a computer locating somewhere in the internet network) based on the IP of the server
, then send a request to the server. The server would send responses in JSON format, and HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, audios files...

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

A route consist of the type of request the server can receive, the endpoint URL
for the request (the endpoint URL may receive params, queries, and request object), 
and a handler function we would like to activate when receiving the request


-------------------
3) The steps below describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

1- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
2- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
3- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
4- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
5- The user's browser displays the HTML it received
